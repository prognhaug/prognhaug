## Welcome, fellow code cosmonaut :rocket:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on integrations for accounting software at Aider AS

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also studying part-time for a degree in backend development, finishing in June 2024

#### :ship: My journey

I used to travel the world, working on offshore rigs keeping software and systems alive. I've tested software and electronics, contributed to bringing factory testing tools to life, and so much more. Now I've jumped off the boat so to speak, and landed with both feet safely planted in a fantastic tech job as a developer in Aider.

#### :computer: My interests in code

Things that doesn't work properly irk me. Repetitive tasks are not my jam. Human error is wasteful. Boring tasks are unhealthy. That's why I want to write code. I don't want to change the world, but I want to change the way people work so they can focus on what they actually enjoy. An application doesn't have to be sexy, but it has to improve something in one way or another. This is what makes me forget time and space, and maybe lunch.

#### :earth_africa: My interests in life

I want to taste everything life has to offer. I play instruments (badly), I sing (even worse), I go for week-long hikes in the norwegian mountains, I climb both in the gym and in the mountains, I surf, I play videogames and much much more.

Laughter should always be cheap and accessible.
